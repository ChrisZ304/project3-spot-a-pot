When your out and about and you need to GO, where do you turn?? You turn to your favorite, and most immediate app: Spot-A-Pot! With just the tap of an icon, your nearest restroom will be just a waddle away!

We've all been there in the peirls of a much needed evacuation. Maybe your out with friends, at a park, maybe a parade, local convention, or on a shopping spree and the urge comes on like an unenvited guest! When those times call, we are here to you give you a rest, and a local room to do that in.

We want users to feel free to go out and about, without the need to call ahead to a desitination unknown as to weither or not a local bathrrom exists. Spot-A-Pot offers comfort from the inevitable needs of human nature. ITs as easy to use as flushing a toilot, perhaps even easier.....

Spot-A-Pot will track your location, of course with your persmission, and locate the nearest restroom to your proximity, just for you!
