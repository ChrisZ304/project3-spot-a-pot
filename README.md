## Description

We've all been there in the perils of a much needed evacuation. Maybe you're out with friends, at a park, at a parade, or on a shopping spree when nature calls like an uninvited guest!

When you're out and about and you need to GO, where do you turn?? You turn to your favorite, and most immediate app: Spot-A-Pot! Spot-A-Pot will track your location, and pin locations on a map to display the closest restrooms in your proximity. With just the tap of an icon, your nearest restroom is just a waddle away!
